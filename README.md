## Overview

The StockPredictor project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict stock market movements. It focuses on forecasting significant price changes and daily closing prices using a combination of Random Forest classifiers and LSTM neural networks. These models are trained on historical data from major stock tickers, providing insights into future market trends.

## Data Collection

- Data is collected using the Yahoo Finance API.
- The dataset includes historical stock prices from January 2021 to the present.
- Data fields include daily opening, closing, high, low prices, and trading volume for each stock.

## Data Preprocessing

### Percentage Change Calculation

- Daily percentage changes in the adjusted close prices are calculated to capture day-to-day volatility.
- A significant daily percentage change is defined as a movement greater than 5%. This threshold helps in identifying high volatility days that are critical for predicting future price movements.

### Lag Features

- Lag features are created by shifting the significant movement indicator for five days.
- These features help in capturing temporal dependencies, essential for time-series forecasting in financial markets.

## Feature Engineering

- Lagged features of significant movements are used as predictors.
- This approach is based on the hypothesis that past volatility patterns provide insights into future price behaviors, a common assumption in financial time series analysis.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Random Forest Model

- A Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict whether there will be a significant price movement (greater than 5%) on a given day.
- This model is effective in handling non-linear relationships and is robust against overfitting in high-dimensional data.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The model's performance is assessed using the F1 score, focusing on the balance between precision and recall, which is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets where significant movements are rare.

### LSTM Network for Price Prediction

- An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network is utilized to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Model Setup:** The LSTM network is designed to capture sequential data patterns, making it well-suited for stock price predictions.
- **Data Scaling:** Input features are normalized using MinMaxScaler to ensure that the LSTM model receives scaled data, optimizing weight updates during training.
- **Training:** The model is trained to predict the next dayâ€™s closing price based on patterns observed over the past 100 days. The training process minimizes prediction errors, measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

## Results

- The Random Forest model achieved an F1 score of **72%**, indicating a good balance between precision and recall in predicting significant price movements.
- The LSTM network achieved a **Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.004** on the test dataset, demonstrating effective short-term prediction capabilities.

## Visualizations

- Model performance and significant price movement patterns are visualized using graphs and plots.
- These visualizations help in better understanding the model's predictions and the stock market's volatility.
